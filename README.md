# HealthcareClaimsPipeline
End-to-end healthcare claims data pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Delta Lake
# 🏥 Healthcare Claims Data Pipeline

This project simulates a **real-time Healthcare Claims Processing Pipeline** — designed to ingest, transform, and analyze claim data efficiently using **Azure Data Factory, Databricks, PySpark, and Delta Lake**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The pipeline demonstrates how healthcare claims flow through different stages:
1. **Raw Claim Data Ingestion** – Collect data from CSV or APIs.
2. **Data Transformation** – Clean, validate, and enrich using PySpark.
3. **Data Storage** – Store processed data in Delta Lake for analytics.
4. **Data Reporting** – Generate summary dashboards (Power BI / SQL).

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** – Orchestration  
- **Azure Databricks** – Processing and transformation  
- **PySpark** – Data cleaning and enrichment  
- **Delta Lake** – Reliable data storage  
- **SQL / Power BI** – Reporting layer
